This is the first version of this game, python 3.4.1 along with compatible version of pygame is required to execute the code along with this are some useful files which were required for the development of this game.If you don't have python no need to worry a setup of this game has given as well,install it and play.

Basically the game is about about dodging from the oncoming cars on your lane and setting a new highscore.You can also select cars which can ultimately effect what cars you race against.

Enjoy!!!
